I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Information Science at Renmin University of China and also serve as a committee member of the iSchools Asia-Pacific Future Information Leaders Network [https://www.ischools.org/ap-fil-network](https://www.ischools.org/ap-fil-network). My research interests include Human-AI Interaction, Information Behavior, and Digital Humanities. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Dr. Hui Yan and Assoc. Prof. Dr. Di Wang.

I focus on both understanding the information behaviors of different people in different contexts and exploring the factors that influence these behaviors, especially in the context of Human-AI Interaction. From 2024 to 2025, I worked with young members of the Nuosu ethnic minority group in rural Sichuan. Additionally, under the guidance of Assoc. Prof. Dr. Di Wang, I participated in an investigation into the application of AI in major public and university libraries across China.

I‘m available at liaojp825@ruc.edu.cn
