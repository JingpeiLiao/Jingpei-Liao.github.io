I am a <strong>second-year Ph.D. student in Information Science</strong> at <strong>Renmin University of China</strong> and also serve as a committee member of the <strong>iSchools Asia-Pacific Future Information Leaders Network</strong> [../images/ischool](https://www.ischools.org/ap-fil-network). My research interests include <strong>Human-AI Interaction</strong>, <strong>Information Behavior</strong>, and <strong>Digital Humanities</strong>. I am fortunate to be advised by <strong>Prof. Dr. Hui Yan</strong> and <strong>Assoc. Prof. Dr. Di Wang</strong>.

I focus on both understanding the information behaviors of different people in different contexts and exploring the factors that influence these behaviors, especially in the context of <strong>Human-AI Interaction</strong>. From <strong>2024 to 2025</strong>, I worked with <strong>young members of the Nuosu ethnic minority group</strong> in rural Sichuan. Additionally, under the guidance of Assoc. Prof. Dr. Di Wang, I participated in an investigation into the application of <strong>AI in major public and university libraries across China</strong>.

I‘m available at <strong>liaojp825@ruc.edu.cn</strong>[../images/email](liaojp825@ruc.edu.cn).
